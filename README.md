# quansu2021 - Updated version of thithuqs-remaster
This is a clone project from hyperion0201. I just update the data and change the design.

### Getting started
Clone this repository.
Then run:

```
$ npm install (or yarn install)      // initial node_modules
$ npm start   (or yarn dev)          // start development server
$ npm run build  (or yarn generate)  // build production files for deploy
```
Open <i>localhost:3000</i> and you are ready to go. Happy coding!
